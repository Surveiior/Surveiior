# About me
Hi, I'm Simone. I am a web developer and video game enthusiast. I enjoy building web apps using React and publishing them on GitHub Pages. I also love developing backends using Java and Spring Framework, which I use to feed my React Single Page Applications and make them more interesting.

In my free time, I like to build video games using powerful editors such as Unreal Engine 5. I'm particularly interested in designing and building user interfaces for video games using Adobe Illustrator.

I am currently collaborating with Stampede Games as a co-founder. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions, and don't forget to check out our Instagram page.

If you have any suggestions for my projects, please email me at <a href="mailto:simonelungarella@gmail.com">simonelungarella@gmail.com</a>. Thank you for visiting my profile!
