# Hi, I'm Simone

### This is my profile. Feel free to check out some of my repositories and visit my deployed pages. If you have any suggestions, please email me at <a href="mailto:simonelungarella@gmail.com"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Gmail-D14836?style=for-the-badge&logo=gmail&logoColor=white" /></a>.

<i>You can learn more about me by visiting my personal <a href="https://simone-lungarella.github.io/">website</a>.</i>

### I enjoy building web apps using <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/React-20232A?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=61DAFB" /> and publishing them on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. I also love developing backends using <b>Java</b> and <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring-6DB33F?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white" alt="Spring Framework"/>, which I use to feed my React Single Page Applications and make them more interesting.

### In my free time, I like to build video games using powerful editors such as <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5">Unreal Engine 5</a>. I'm particularly interested in designing and building user interfaces for video games using <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Adobe%20Illustrator-FF9A00?style=for-the-badge&logo=adobe%20illustrator&logoColor=white" alt="Adobe Illustrator"/>.

### I am currently collaborating with <a href="https://github.com/StampedeStudios">Stampede Games</a> as a co-founder. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions.
